    <h2>Redirecting input to output</h2>
    <p>
        The simpliest signal chain that one can construct is connecting the input audio
        signal to the output.
        <div class="figure">

    </p>
    <p>
        When running this circuit, the audio input (e.g. microphone) is redirected
        to the output (e.g. speaker) without and modification. Signal waveform and its
        spectrum is shown in the <em>Audio output</em> panel.
    </p>

    <h2>Low-pass filtering</h2>
    <p>
        We can make the circuit a bit more interesting by introducing some filtering of
        the input signal before sending it to the output. In the <em>Filters</em> group of the
        <em>Audio Units</em> panel there is LP/HP Filter that we can use. This is a simple
        low-pass or high-pass filter. We will need two of those since we are dealing with
        a stereo signal.
    </p>
    <p>
        To control the filters cut-off frequency we will be using a slider unit that can be found
        in the <em>Signal flow</em> group. When dropping the slider onto the working canvas check
        its properties. We want to change its label to be <i>Cut-off</i> and the range of values
        from say 10 to 10000 (Hz), which represents the range of frequencies we want to operate in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connect the slider's output to the <em>f</em> inputs of the both filters.

        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now when you run this circuit you can play with the slider to filter the audio in real-time.
    </p>

    <h2>Making an echo</h2>
    <p>
        We can create a simple echo effect by introducing a delay on the audio signal line
        and then mixing the original signal with the delayed one together. This will create a
        "signle reflection" echo effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here to simplify the circuit we add together left and right samples of the input to create a
        monophonic signal using the <em>Added</em> unit. Then the signal goes into a delay line set to
        100ms.
        <div class="rfigure">
            <img src="images/tutorial/au_echo_simple.png">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        If we want to create a "multiple reflection" echo effect we have to loop the delayed signal
        back to the input recursively. Such a feedback look can actually make the signal chain unstable
        and turn it into a generator. To avoid this we will have to damp the signal we feed back into the input.
        To do so we can for example multiply it with a value less then 1, say 0.5.
        <div class="rfigure">
            <img src="images/tutorial/au_echo_feedback.png">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        We can make the circuit even more flexible by adding sliders to control the delay time and the
        damping. The <em>Delay</em> audio unit has a second input called 'delay', which accepts a delay
        time fraction (value in 0..1 range) of the total delay set via the unit's properties panel.
        Now, if we set the total delay to 1000ms and add the slider to output a value in 0..1 range we can
        control the delay within 0..1s range with our slider. We can do the same for the damping factor.
        <div class="rfigure">
            <img src="images/tutorial/au_echo_feedback_ctrl.png">
        </div>
        Now we can vary the echo delay and damping in real-time by adjusting the sliders' positions.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can make the echo effect even more realisting by applygin a filtering on the delayed signal.
        Low-pass filter can be used here for example.
