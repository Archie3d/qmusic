    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <p>
        At the very first start of the application after the installation it will present all
        available interface features at their default configuration.
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="images/tutorial/first_screen.png">
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <em>Audio Units</em> panel on the left lists all available plugins.
        Audio units can be dragged from this panel and dropped onto the central
        canvas, which is a working area to construct the circuit.
    <p>

    <p>
        In the right there is the <em>Audio output</em> panel that will display
        the signal waveforma and its spectrum.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <em>Properties</em> panel lists of the configurable properties of an audio
        unit currently selected on the working area. Audio units can be configured via these
        properties panel during the desisn. Some uints allow configuration to be changed even
        during the playback.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the bottom there is the <em>Console</em> panel, where application prints all the
        logs and error messages. Over it there is a piano keyboard that shows the notes being
        currently played via the MIDI input or keyboard.
    </p>

    <p>
        The panels can be moved around and docked at different locations. The application will
        memorize the changes done to its interface and will restore them upon the next launch.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructing Circuits</h2>
    <p>
        In QMusic audio circuits are constructing by dragging the audio units from the panel
        onto the working area. Each audio unit has connection pads, which are used to connect
        the units together and steer the signal flow. In order to make a connection between the
        units click onto one pad and drag the wire onto another one. The connection will be established
        upon the mouse button release.
        <div class="rfigure">
            <img src="images/tutorial/au_connect.png">
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        Audio units in QMusic may have the input connectors on their left side, and outputs on their right.
        A single output can be connected to several inputs. But an input can receive signal only from a
        single output.
    </p>

    <p>
        The signals in QMusic chains are normalized. The audio samples value sits in -1..1 range.
        If it goes outside this range the clipping occurs.
    </p>

    <h2>Audio Interfaces</h2>
    <p>
        Before you start making any sound you have to configure the audio interfaces appropriately.
        To do so open the <em>Settings</em> dialog box via the <em>Sound/Settings...</em> menu.
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="images/tutorial/settings.png">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        From the settings dialog select your input and output audio interfaces. Depending on your system
        hardware some configuration may work better or do not work at all. For better performance it is
        recommended to use ASIO interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on the hardware capabilities a range of sample rates will be presented. <em>44.1kHz</em> is
        a commonly used sample rate supported by all current audio devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Buffer size</em> is an important parameter to be considered when using QMusic in real-time audio
        processing or synthesis. Minimizing the buffer size leads to better responsivenes and smaller delay times,
        however can result in unexpected sound glitches if the CPU is not performant enough or the system is loaded.
        ASIO devices claim shorter delays and can be used with smaller buffers.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you intend to control QMusic via MIDI interface you will have too select a <em>MIDI In</em> device
        and corresponding <em>MIDI channel</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the way, you can run seleral instances of QMusic application listening on different MIDI input channels.
        This allows playing different synthesized instruments simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h2>Running The Signal Chain</h2>
    <p>
        Signal chain evaluation starts when pressing the <img src="images/tutorial/play.png" class="inline"> button.
        Check the console window for any configuration errors when starting the playback.
    </p>
    <p>
        While playback is active the work area is locked: no items can be added, deleter, or modified. However
        the audio unit properties can still be modified in real-time.
    </p>
    <p>
        To stop the signal chain evaluation press the <img src="images/tutorial/stop.png" class="inline"> button.
        This will unlock the working area for modifications.
    </p>
